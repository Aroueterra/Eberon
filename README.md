# Eberon
Remaster of the rpg framework using new c++ data structure knowledge and the libtcod library.

The target feature to be implemented is procedural dungeon generation. 
-1st implementation: Random room generation.
-2nd implementation: Set rooms generation based on Json seed file.
-3rd implementation: Pre-generated rooms with capability to read seed files as auxilliary rooms.



Everything is still under construction! Nothing playable atm.
